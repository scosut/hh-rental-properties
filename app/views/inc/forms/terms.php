				<p>I hereby apply to lease the above described premises for the term and upon the above conditions set forth and agree that rent is to be payable the first day of each month in advance. I warrant that all statements above set forth are true.</p>

				<p>When so approved and accepted, I agree to execute an agreement to rent. I understand the rental will be a one-year lease. I understand it is recommended to carry a renter's insurance policy while at the premises for my own personal property. I also agree before possession is given to pay the balance of the security deposit and first month's rent prior to the move in date. I recognize that as part of your procedure for processing my application, a credit report and background check are required.</p>

				<p>I understand no pets or smoking are allowed and non-compliance will result in the loss of the security deposit as well as charges for damages incurred as a result of non-compliance, which may be grounds for termination of the tenancy.</p>

				<p>I certify that all the information provided above is true and correct and understand any lease or rental agreement may be terminated if I have made any material false or incomplete statements in this application. I authorize verification of the information provided in this application from my credit sources, credit bureaus, background check, current and previous landlords/employers, and personal references.</p>
